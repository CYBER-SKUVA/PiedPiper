Hi, This is the PiedPipers of Mobile Development.
We made this project for our second year Mobile computing app project.
We used our expertise in Java, SQL, PHP, JSON and xml. It was a challenging project and exciting.
We hope you have as much fun viewing the app as we did when we were developing it, We to hear your amazing comments and commits.
Thank you!
